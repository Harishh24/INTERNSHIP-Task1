##    OVERVEIW OF THE PROJECT
### Overview

This project is a **Weather Forecast Dashboard** built using Python. It fetches real-time weather data for a specified city from the OpenWeatherMap API and visualizes temperature, humidity, and wind speed trends over time using `matplotlib` and `seaborn`. The project demonstrates how to work with APIs, handle JSON responses, and create meaningful data visualizations.


### Key Attributes

1. **API Integration**: Utilizes the OpenWeatherMap API to fetch 5-day weather forecasts in 3-hour intervals for a specific city.
2. **Data Parsing and Handling**:
   - Parses JSON responses to extract relevant information like temperature, humidity, wind speed, and timestamps.
   - Handles potential API errors gracefully with error-checking mechanisms.
3. **Data Visualization**:
   - Uses `matplotlib` and `seaborn` to plot temperature, humidity, and wind speed trends over time.
   - Employs a clean, user-friendly layout with multiple subplots for a dashboard-like experience.
4. **DataFrame Usage**:
   - Converts the extracted data into a `pandas` DataFrame for easier handling and visualization.
5. **User-Centric Design**:
   - Ensures x-axis labels are readable by auto-formatting timestamps.
   - Provides actionable feedback when API requests fail or when data is unavailable.


### Objectives

1. **Demonstrate API Usage**:
   - Illustrate how to send requests to APIs, handle responses, and process JSON data for practical applications.

2. **Enhance Data Visualization Skills**:
   - Showcase how to use `matplotlib` and `seaborn` to create aesthetically pleasing and informative plots.

3. **Provide Real-Time Insights**:
   - Offer users a clear and concise view of weather trends to help with planning and decision-making.

4. **Build a Reusable Framework**:
   - Create a modular and reusable codebase that can be easily adapted for other cities or data sources.

5. **Promote Learning and Collaboration**:
   - Encourage users to learn about API integration, data handling, and visualization by providing well-documented, open-source code.
